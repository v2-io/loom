# Loom

**Weave living documentation for AI agents.**

Loom transforms Elixir code, PRAXES patterns, and architecture documents into Obsidian-flavored markdown with:

- üîó **Rich cross-references** - Automatic wikilinks and backlinks
- üìä **Queryable metadata** - Frontmatter + Dataview queries
- üåê **Knowledge graphs** - Topology emerges from relationships
- üé® **Semantic markup** - Callouts, diagrams, math notation
- ü§ñ **AI-agent optimized** - Structured for machine consumption

## Vision

Documentation as a **living knowledge base** that:

1. **Consumes** multiple sources (ExDoc, PRAXES, ADRs, transcripts)
2. **Weaves** them together (cross-links, unified metadata, queries)
3. **Serves** AI agents (structured, queryable, graph-traversable)

## Status

üöß **Pre-alpha** - Initial research and design phase

See:
- [`thoughts.md`](thoughts.md) - Research findings and architectural thinking
- [`obsidian-flavored-markdown.md`](obsidian-flavored-markdown.md) - Technical specification

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: ExDoc Formatter (Week 1)
- [x] Project initialization
- [ ] Basic markdown generation from ExDoc nodes
- [ ] Frontmatter extraction from module attributes
- [ ] Wikilink conversion for module references
- [ ] File structure (mirrors module hierarchy)

### Phase 2: Obsidian Enhancements (Week 2)
- [ ] Callout conversion (warnings, examples, deprecations)
- [ ] Mermaid diagram generation (supervision trees)
- [ ] Dataview index generation
- [ ] Tag hierarchy normalization

### Phase 3: Multi-Source Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] PRAXES importer
- [ ] Architecture doc linker
- [ ] Cross-source wikilink resolution

### Phase 4: AI Agent Tooling (Week 4+)
- [ ] Graph traversal API
- [ ] Semantic search integration
- [ ] Query builder for common patterns

## Usage (Future)

```bash
# Generate Obsidian vault from Elixir project
mix loom.generate --vault ~/vaults/my-project

# Import PRAXES
mix loom.import.praxes ~/eli/_shared/PRAXES --vault ~/vaults/my-project

# Generate indices
mix loom.index --vault ~/vaults/my-project
```

## Installation

**Not yet published to Hex.**

For development:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:loom, path: "~/src/loom"}
  ]
end
```

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Loom is an Elixir Mix project. Core source lives under `lib/`, currently anchored by `Loom` and the namespaces it will grow (`Loom.*`). Tests mirror modules in `test/` using `*_test.exs`. Generated build artifacts stay in `_build/`, while vendored dependencies are in `deps/`; avoid committing either. Project-wide reference docs and research notes (`README.md`, `thoughts.md`, `obsidian-flavored-markdown.md`) sit at the repository root‚Äîuse them before proposing architecture changes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `mix deps.get` ‚Äì install or update dependencies; run after pulling new commits.
- `mix compile` ‚Äì compile Elixir sources; surfaces warnings you should resolve before review.
- `mix test` ‚Äì execute ExUnit suites, including doctests; required pre-push.
- `mix docs` ‚Äì render Obsidian-flavored markdown via ExDoc once formatter modules land.
- `iex -S mix` ‚Äì open an interactive shell for exploring loom helpers during development.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Format all changes with `mix format`; it enforces two-space indentation, consistent pipe alignment, and spacing rules. Modules use `CamelCase` (e.g., `Loom.Formatter.Markdown`), functions and variables use `snake_case`, and predicate helpers should end in `?`. Name files after the primary module (`lib/loom/formatter/markdown.ex`) and keep public APIs documented with `@doc` plus doctests where practical. Include focused module-level docstrings to feed downstream knowledge graph tooling.

## Testing Guidelines
Use ExUnit for unit and integration coverage, keeping doctests synchronized with example outputs (`@moduledoc` and `@doc` blocks). Mirror module structure in `test/` and suffix individual tests with the feature under exercise (e.g., `"generates frontmatter"`). Aim for meaningful assertions rather than structural pattern matches, and target ‚â•80% coverage using `mix test --cover` when touching core transformers. When adding Mix tasks, prefer CLI smoke tests that verify key options.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commit subjects in the imperative, mirroring the existing history (`Initial loom project: ‚Ä¶`). Group related changes, and keep descriptions under 72 characters with optional detail in the body. Pull requests should include: (1) a concise summary of the problem and approach, (2) references to relevant design docs or issues, and (3) verification notes (`mix test`, `mix format`). Add screenshots or vault diffs when the change affects generated markdown so reviewers‚Äîand downstream agents‚Äîgrasp the impact quickly.
